Promise is not created to solve the callback hell issue in JavaScript.

It is actually an independent concept.

Helping to solve the callback hell issue is just an benefit promise brings along.

There are of course other ways to help with the callback issue.

 - Give anonymous function a name to help debugging

 - Extract anonymous callback to a named function to keep the code shallow

 - Modularize
